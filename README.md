First time trying out React Native so i decided to try and make a simple todo app, i used this tutorial and built upon that with more features.


Tutorial by Made With Matt can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kL6nhutjQ8

Preview: (Subject to change as i am currently building this app)

How mine looks like:

More things i want to add:
0. fix bugs and clean up code as it's not good
1. Simple database
2. Notes tab
3. calendar for notes/tasks so you can get notified
4. Publish it to google play store, hopefully.
