First time trying out React Native so i decided to try and make a simple todo app, i used this tutorial and built upon that with more features.

More things i want to add:

1. Simple database
2. Notes tab
3. calendar for notes/tasks so you can get notified
4. Publish it to google play store, hopefully.
